### Project will probably not be updated
I lost motivation about this project and for a exemple webapp it's good for me, but sadly I don't like FireBase (actually), I prefere to use self hosted mysql and create my API.
At least I tried this technologie and my base code is not in my standart so I prefer to open it (do to unkownledge about firebase and firestore) but i'm open if you want to contact and speak about it on discord (rurueuh)
